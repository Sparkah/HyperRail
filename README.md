# HyperRail

**Problem**

Getting funds onto Hyperliquid is fragmented and too complicated for non crypto natives:

- Card users can't onramp directly

- Crypto users must manually bridge to arbitrum manage gas fees, and deposit to HyperCore

- No way to gift/tip trading capital to others

- New users drop off during multi-step onboarding funding with gas and doing many bridges to get to hyperliquid venue

**User Flows**

**Flow 1: Fund Own Wallet**

Choose payment method → Enter amount → Confirm → Auto-deposit to HyperCore → Trade

**Flow 2: Send to Someone**

Enter recipient (alice@gmail.com / 0x... ) → Choose amount →

Generate claim link → Recipient claims → Deposited to their HyperCore
